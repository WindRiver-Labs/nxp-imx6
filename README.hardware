NOTE: WR offers limited support for these Graphics capabilities under the
specific conditions we have performed validation and testing for. There is
only GPU driver source code in kernel tree. About userspace libs, because of
license limitation, there is no source code supplied by WR. If you need deeper
support, please connect with NXP to get authorization for userspace libs
source code firstly, and then contact WR Sales team to engage WR Professional
Services who can work with you to discuss and customize support for your deeper
graphics requirements.

3.3 Unsupported Features
========================

The following features are not supported and validated:

	x ESAI card
	x SPDIF codec
