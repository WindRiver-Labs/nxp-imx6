		 nfsroot=<nfs server>:<nfs root>,v3,tcp \
		 ip=<target IP>::<gateway>:<netmask>::eth0:off \
		 video=mxcfb0:dev=ldb,LDB-XGA,if=RGB666
	# bootz 0x12000000 - 0x18000000

5. Features
===========

Some peripherals and drivers have been tested using the libraries and testcases
in the imx-lib and imx-test packages. These two packages are included in the 
Freescale SDK.  You can build them under the Freescale openembedded-core layer of the
meta-fsl-arm environment. Please reference https://github.com/Freescale/meta-fsl-arm
for build details.  

After the build completes: 

* all testcases are installed to ${fsl_target_rootfs}/unit_tests, 
* all needed libs are installed to ${fsl_target_rootfs}/usr/lib, 
* all needed firmware is installed to ${fsl_target_rootfs}/lib/firmware/vpu, 
  where fsl_target_rootfs parameter points to the path of the root filesystem after 
  building the freescale SDK.

Copy the testcases to the image of the i.MX6Q Board: (assuming the target
image has been properly deployed to an MMC/SD card as in described in section 3.2):

	# cp ${fsl_target_rootfs}/unit_tests /mnt/sd -rf
	# cp ${fsl_target_rootfs}/usr/lib/libvpu.* /mnt/sd/usr/lib/ -rf
	# cp ${fsl_target_rootfs}/usr/lib/libipu.* /mnt/sd/usr/lib/ -rf
	# cp ${fsl_target_rootfs}/lib/firmware/vpu /mnt/sd/lib/firmware/ -rf
	# umount /mnt/sd


5.1 fbdev HDMI
--------------

To enable HDMI as the default framebuffer device, add:

	video=mxcfb0:dev=hdmi,1920x1080M@60,if=RGB24

to the bootargs parameter of U-Boot.

5.2 fbdev LVDS
--------------

"ldb=spl0/1"       --      split mode on DI0/1
"ldb=dul0/1"       --      dual mode on DI0/1
"ldb=sin0/1"       --      single mode on LVDS0/1
"ldb=sep0/1"       --      separate mode begin from LVDS0/1

There are two LVDS channels (LVDS0 and LVDS1) that can transfer video
data. These two channels can be used in split, dual, single, and separate 
modes.

* Split mode means display data from DI0 or DI1 will be sent
  to both channels LVDS0 + LVDS1.
* Dual mode means display data from DI0 or DI1 will be
  duplicated on LVDS0 and LVDS1. That said, LVDS0 and LVDS1
  have the same content.
* Single mode will only work for DI0/DI1->LVDS0 or DI0/DI1->LVDS1.
* Separate mode means you can make DI0/DI1->LVDS0 and DI0/DI1->LVDS1
  work at the same time.


To enable LVDS as the default framebuffer device, add:

	For the LVDS0 connection:
	video=mxcfb0:dev=ldb,LDB-XGA,if=RGB666

	For the LVDS1 connection:
	video=mxcfb0:dev=ldb,LDB-XGA,if=RGB666 ldb=sin1

to the bootargs parameter of U-Boot.


5.3 VPU
-------

To test VPU support, ensure that the HDMI is the default fbdev. Please refer to 
section 4.1, above, to set the bootargs of U-Boot, then execute the following 
commands:

	# cd /unit_tests/
	# ./mxc_vpu_test.out -D "-i ./akiyo.mp4 -f 0 -t 1"

5.4 V4L2 output/capture and camera
----------------------------------

Enable HDMI as the default fbdev as stated in section 4.1, above, then execute
the following commands:

	# cd /unit_tests/
	# ./mxc_v4l2_overlay.out -iw 640 -ih 480 -ow 640 -oh 480 -m 0 -di /dev/video1 -fg

5.5 USB feature
---------------

5.5.1 USB OTG Usage and verification
------------------------------------

1. Verify the OTG device mode

Plug in cable B and connect to the host machine.

Board configuration:

	# ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.10

Host machine configuration:

	# sudo ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.100
	# ping 192.168.1.10 -c 2
	PING 192.168.1.10 (192.168.1.10) 56(84) bytes of data.
	64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=2.06 ms
	64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_req=2 ttl=64 time=0.286 ms
	...

2. Switch to OTG host mode

Replace cable B with cable A.


5.6 Audio
---------

5.6.1 Audio capture and playback(WM8962)
----------------------------------------

1. Capture

Set the parameters to assign the codec and then record an audio message:

	For i.MX6Q/S:
	# amixer set 'MIXINR IN3R' on
	# amixer set 'INPGAR IN3R' on

	For i.MX6UL:
	# amixer cset name='ADC PCM Capture Volume' 80%,80%
	# arecord -Dplughw:0,0 -r 44100 -f S16_LE -c 2 -d 5 record.wav

2. Playback

	For i.MX6Q/S:
	# amixer cset name='Headphone Volume' 127

	FOr i.MX6UL:
	# amixer cset name="Headphone Playback Volume" 80%,80
	# aplay  record.wav


5.6.2 Audio HDMI playback
-------------------------

Connect the board to an HDMI display with an HDMI cable,
then enable fbdev HDMI as in section 4.1, above.

Play the recorded audio messages:

	# aplay -Dhw:1,0 record.wav


5.7 Static PM
-------------

The debug UART can be set as a wakeup source with:
	# echo enabled > /sys/class/tty/ttymxc0/power/wakeup
	# echo mem > /sys/power/state

5.8 CPU frequency
------------------

CPU frequency scaling allows the clock speed of the CPU to be changed on the fly.

	# echo powersave > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
	# cat /proc/cpuinfo

5.9 Backlight
--------------

	# echo 0 > /sys/class/backlight/backlight/brightness

5.10 ANATOP thermal
-------------------

	To check current CPU temperature
	# cd /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0
	# cat temp
	39445
	# cat trip_point_0_type
	passive
	# cat trip_point_0_temp
	85000
	# echo 39445 > trip_point_0_temp
	System is too hot. GPU3D will work at 1/64 clock.

	# cat trip_point_1_type
	critical
	# echo 39445 > trip_point_1_temp
	The system will shutdown

5.11 Touch Screen
-----------------

	# mtdev-test /dev/input/event0

5.12 PCIe
--------

Since the on-board PCIe connector only exports the PETP0/N0, PERP0/N0 and 3.3V
pins, any mini-PCIe devices that use other PCIe pins are not supported.
The following PCIe peripherals:

	Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205
	Intel Centrino Wireless-N 1030

can be validated using the following steps:

Simply add line as follows to ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf:

	KERNEL_FEATURES_append = " features/iwlwifi/iwlwifi.scc"

Include the following lines in your local.conf:

	LINUX_KERNEL_TYPE = "standard"
	KERNEL_FEATURES_append = " features/iwlwifi/iwlwifi.scc"

This will include the iwlwifi and mac80211 kernel modules in
the root filesystem.

Built and install them:

	# bitbake wrlinux-image-glibc-xxx

Copy relevant WiFi card firmware (Intel 6205 WiFi firmware: iwlwifi-6000g2a-5.ucode)
of to /lib/firmware of the target image.

Execute the following commands to validate the WiFi cards:

	# ifconfig wlan0 up
	# iwconfig wlan0 essid <AP essid>
	# dhclient wlan0
	# ping <AP address> -i wlan0 -c 1

NOTE: the PCIe driver does not support hotplug and suspend/resume.

5.13 Graphics/GPU
-----------------

Since the graphics support in the fsl-imx6 is provided via binaries,
the graphics package must be compiled according to Freescale's EULA.

Add the following to your local.conf file to configure the project:
	
	DISTRO ?= "wrlinux-std-sato"

Add the following to your bblayers.conf file:

	WRTEMPLATE ?= "feature/imx-extend-support"

NOTE:
You must change the configuration to allow downloading of packages from the
internet. Change BB_NO_NETWORK ?= "1" to BB_NO_NETWORK ?= "0" in the file
${buildprj}/conf/local.conf.

5.14 Tune
-----------------
This BSP uses "armv7athf-neon" as the default tune. It supports both
cortexa9 and cortexa7, but may not have the best optimization. If you use
this BSP for the boards "i.MX 6Quad SABRE-SD" and "i.MX 6SoloX SABRE-SD", and
want better optimization from tune, change DEFAULTTUNE from "armv7athf-neon" 
to "cortexa9thf-neon" locally in ${projectdir}/conf/local.conf.

6. kexec/kdump
==============

For discussion purposes, some useful terminology will be described here.

* boot kernel - the first kernel that you start and supports kexec, from U-Boot
	      for instance
* capture kernel - the kernel that you reboot into after a boot kernel crash

To build the boot kernel, enable kexec and kdump in your local.conf file:

	WRTEMPLATE = "feature/kexec feature/kdump"	

To reserve a memory region for the capture kernel, you need to pass the bootargs 
argument "crashkernel" as follow:

for I.MX6Q:
    crashkernel=256M@512M

For the dump-capture kernel:
Before booting the dump-capture kernel, add "maxcpus=1" to the boot parameter.
NOTE: Use zImage as a secondary kernel. It can be found in the
  build/linux-windriver/4.1-r0/linux-fsl_imx6-standard-build/arch/arm/boot
directory.

For more detailed info about kdump, refer to Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt
in the kernel source tree.

7. Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
===================================

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator, wic, to create the properly
partitioned image on a SD card. The wic command
generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
User can refer to the below URL to get more WIC details:

http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.2/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#creating-partitioned-images

This BSP supports disk images for SD card.
After build the project, user will get a WIC image under the directory
tmp/deploy/images/<bsp name>/ ,such as:

tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-imx6/wrlinux-image-glibc-std-sato-nxp-imx6-imx6q.wic
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-imx6/wrlinux-image-glibc-std-sato-nxp-imx6-imx6sx.wic

Then user can write the output image to a SD card:

Since this BSP doesn't have a firmware to read the uboot from a partition table,
WIC image only contains kernel, dtb and rootfs. We still need to write U-boot
image to SD card directly by "dd" command.

7.1 Burn images to SD card
--------------------------

To burn uboot and WIC images to SD card, user need to execute command:

For i.mx6q:
# dd if=wrlinux-image-glibc-std-sato-nxp-imx6-imx6q.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

For i.mx6sx:
# dd if=wrlinux-image-glibc-std-sato-nxp-imx6-imx6sx.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

7.2 Set uboot env
-----------------

Board can boot automatically by set the below uboot environment variables:

For i.mx6q:

=> setenv bootfile zImage; setenv fdtfile imx6q-sabresd.dtb;  setenv loadaddr 0x12000000; setenv fdtaddr 0x18000000;

=> setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rw rootdelay=5 console=ttymxc0,115200n8'

=> setenv bootcmd 'fatload mmc 1:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 1:1 $fdtaddr $fdtfile; bootz $loadaddr - $fdtaddr';

=> saveenv; run bootcmd;

For i.mx6sx

=> setenv bootfile zImage; setenv fdtfile imx6sx-sdb.dtb;  setenv loadaddr 0x80800000; setenv fdtaddr 0x83000000;

=> setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk2p2 rw rootdelay=5 console=ttymxc0,115200n8'

=> setenv bootcmd 'fatload mmc 2:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 2:1 $fdtaddr $fdtfile; bootz $loadaddr - $fdtaddr';

=> saveenv; run bootcmd;
